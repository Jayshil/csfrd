The idea is to use luminosity function (the Schechter function) with the updated parameters from the literature to compute the luminosity density and then using this updated luminosity function to calculate the star formation rate density. In this notebook we try to summarize our work."

    "The Schechter function (Schechter 1975) is an analytic expression for the luminosity of galaxies which can be written as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\phi(L) = \\left( \\frac{\\phi^*}{L^*} \\right) \\left( \\frac{L}{L^*} \\right)^\\alpha \\exp{\\left( -\\frac{L}{L^*} \\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This function essentially describes the number of galaxies in the given range of luminosity $L$ to $L+dL$. It is evident from the above equation that it is a three parameter function with parameters $\\phi^*$, $L^*$ and $\\alpha$. Here, $\\alpha$ represents the power-law parameter for the faint-end and $L^*$ is the characteristic luminosity, while $\\phi*$ serves as the normalisation constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can integrate this function over luminosity to find the luminosity density meaning in the sense that the total luminosity coming oout of the given region. We use the `scipy` function `scipy.integrate.simps` function to perform the following integration:\n",

    "Here, $L_{min}$ is the minimum luminosity at the faint end which we have taken as the lower end for the above integration. It is evident that the luminosity density will depend on the exact value of $L_{min}$. But for now, we take this value from the Madau & Dickinson (2014) paper, which is $0.03L_*$ ($L_*$ is the characteristic luminosity from the Schechter function).\n",
