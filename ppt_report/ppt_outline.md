# Outline of the presentation

- Introduction
    1. What is SFRD?: cosmic history of SFRD; two components of SFRD (IR and UV)
    2. Why is it important?: fundamental property; growth of galaxy, metal enrichment; history of reionisation
    3. Approach to compute SFRD: from luminosity functions; conversion factor kappa
    4. Context of the present work: new measurements in UV, IR LF; avoiding dust corrections; performing integration a differernt way
- Computing SFRD from LF
    1. Luminosity functions: the Schechter function and its parameters; other luminosity function used
    2. Integration LF to find the luminosity density: Different ways to perform the integration
    3. SFRD from the luminosity density at various redshifts
- Results
    1. New measurements of SFRD from the results
    2. Best fitted function to SFRD: Madau & Dickinson (2014) function and its variations; total SFRD and its characteristics
    3. Changing the lower limit of integration: How SFRD (and the best fitted-function) changes?
- Summary
